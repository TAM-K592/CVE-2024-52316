CVE-2024-52316 - Apache Tomcat Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Overview

CVE202452316 is an authentication bypass vulnerability identified in Apache Tomcat. This issue arises when Tomcat is configured with a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC) `ServerAuthContext` component. If an exception occurs during the authentication process and the component does not explicitly set an HTTP status code to indicate failure, the authentication process may incorrectly succeed, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.

 Affected Versions
The following versions of Apache Tomcat are affected by this vulnerability:

| Version Series      | Affected Versions               |
| Apache Tomcat 11.0  | Versions prior to 11.0.0        |
| Apache Tomcat 10.1  | Versions prior to 10.1.31       |
| Apache Tomcat 9.0   | Versions prior to 9.0.96        |

 Exploitability
 Attack Vector
 Exploitation: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the authentication flow to trigger an exception in the custom `ServerAuthContext`. If the exception is not properly handled (i.e., no failure status is set), the attacker could gain unauthorized access.
 Potential Impact:
   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   System compromise or privilege escalation.
   Circumvention of resource isolation mechanisms.

 Mitigation
 
Upgrades
It is strongly recommended to upgrade to a patched version of Apache Tomcat to address this issue:
 Apache Tomcat 11.0.0 or later.
 Apache Tomcat 10.1.31 or later.
 Apache Tomcat 9.0.96 or later.

 Configuration Best Practices
1. Ensure any custom Jakarta Authentication `ServerAuthContext` components properly handle exceptions and explicitly set failure HTTP status codes (`401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`).
2. Regularly audit custom authentication logic for security flaws.

 Detection and Monitoring
 Enable server logging to monitor suspicious authentication activity.
 Deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and block unauthorized attempts.
